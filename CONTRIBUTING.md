# Contributing

Thank you for improving `aws.modules.vpc`. This guide covers the toolchain, the local quality gate, how features are tested and where they belong, commit and pull request conventions, and how releases are cut.

## Development setup

The module targets Terraform `>= 1.7.0, < 2.0.0` and is developed against 1.7.5, the version the consuming platform pins. Install the toolchain:

| Tool | Purpose | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) | Pin the Terraform version | `tfenv install 1.7.5 && tfenv use 1.7.5` |
| [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) | Lint with the Terraform and AWS rulesets configured in `.tflint.hcl` | `brew install tflint && tflint --init` |
| [terraform-docs](https://terraform-docs.io) v0.20.0 | Generate the inputs and outputs tables in every README. Pinned to the version bundled by the CI docs action; newer releases change table formatting and fail the drift check (`make docs` refuses other versions). | Download the v0.20.0 binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs/releases/tag/v0.20.0) |
| [checkov](https://www.checkov.io) | Static security policy | `pip install checkov` |
| [trivy](https://trivy.dev) | Misconfiguration scanning | `brew install trivy` |
| [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) | Run the gate on every commit | `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install` |

Clone, initialise without a backend, and run the gate once to confirm the setup:

```sh
terraform init -backend=false -input=false
make check
```

## Integration suites

`tests/integration/` holds credential-driven suites that apply the module for real and destroy everything afterwards. They are never part of `make check` or the quality pipeline. Run them against your own account before a release that touches resource behaviour:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=<profile> AWS_REGION=<region>
make integration-smoke        # a private VPC, a gateway endpoint, flow logs with a created key; no charge
make integration-nat-egress   # public and private tiers, an internet gateway, one NAT gateway; a few cents
```

Add a suite when a feature's correctness depends on the AWS API rather than on rendering (for example a new gateway type or a flow-log destination). Keep every value derived from the environment, choose CIDRs that cannot collide with anything real, keep any fixture in `tests/integration/setup` (which the policy scans exclude), and never reference a real account, IPAM pool, Transit Gateway, or KMS key.

## The local gate

`make check` is the default target and the same gate CI runs. It stops at the first failing target and must pass before you open a pull request.

| Target | What it runs |
| --- | --- |
| `make fmt` | `terraform fmt -check -recursive -diff` from the repository root. `make fmt-fix` rewrites the files instead. |
| `make init` | `terraform init -backend=false` in the root, every submodule, every example directory, and the integration fixtures. |
| `make validate` | `make init` followed by `terraform validate` in each of those directories. |
| `make lint` | `tflint --init` and then `tflint` in every directory with the root `.tflint.hcl`: documented and typed variables, documented outputs, snake_case naming, no unused declarations, pinned required versions and providers. |
| `make test` | `terraform test` in the root and in each `modules/*` directory (`subnets`, `routes`, `endpoints`, `flow-logs`, `internet`, `ipam`, `ipam-organization-admin`). No credentials are needed. |
| `make docs` | `terraform-docs -c .terraform-docs.yml` in every directory with terraform-docs v0.20.0, regenerating the tables between the `BEGIN_TF_DOCS` and `END_TF_DOCS` markers. Run it after touching any variable or output. |
| `make docs-check` | The same in `--output-check` mode: fails when a README is out of date. This is the variant `make check` and CI run. |
| `make security` | `checkov -d . --framework terraform`, and `trivy config --severity HIGH,CRITICAL` when trivy is on the PATH. A skip needs an inline `checkov:skip=` comment with a reason on the resource it concerns, like the one on the endpoint security group. |
| `make lock` | Refresh the committed root `.terraform.lock.hcl` with hashes for linux and macOS on amd64 and arm64 after changing the provider constraint. CI runs `terraform init` before the docs drift check, so a lock file missing the Linux hash gets rewritten and fails that check. |
| `make integration-smoke`, `make integration-nat-egress` | The integration suites above, against the account and region in your environment. |
| `make clean` | Remove every `.terraform` directory and every lock file below the root. |
| `make check` | `fmt`, `validate`, `lint`, `test`, `docs-check`, `security`, in that order. |

## Test-first workflow

Every behaviour in this module is pinned by a test before it is implemented. Write the failing `run` block first, then the code, then run `make test`.

- Tests live in `tests/*.tftest.hcl` for the root (`defaults` for the sandbox-network inputs and platform names, `composition` for the full multi-tier shape and target resolution, `validation` for every precondition and validation) and `modules/<name>/tests/*.tftest.hcl` for each submodule. Each file starts with `mock_provider "aws" {}` and a `variables` block holding a valid baseline; each `run` overrides only what it exercises.
- Use `command = plan`. Nothing here talks to AWS, so tests run in seconds and in CI without credentials.
- Validations are tested with `expect_failures`. Point it at the object that carries the check: `[var.subnets]` for a variable validation, `[aws_vpc.this]` for the root's cross-reference preconditions, `[aws_route.this]` for the default-route guard, `[aws_nat_gateway.this]` for a public gateway without an internet gateway, `[check.single_az]` for a `check` block. A run with `expect_failures` passes only if exactly those objects fail; a run that triggers a `check` as a side effect (for example any run with `internet` set fires `check.internet_path_declared`) must list it too. Add a positive run alongside so the happy path is covered.
- Assertions must not depend on unknown values. With a mock provider, computed attributes such as IDs and ARNs are unknown at plan time, so assert on arguments you set (`cidr_block`, `tags`, `policy`), on counts and instance keys, and on outputs derived from inputs (`subnet_cidr_blocks_by_tier`, `flow_log_group_name`). The flow-logs tests declare `mock_data` for `aws_partition`, `aws_region`, and `aws_caller_identity` so the fallback path is fully known.
- `||` and `&&` do not short-circuit in Terraform 1.7. Both operands are always evaluated, so `var.x == null || var.x.field > 0` fails when `x` is null. Guard with a conditional instead: `var.x == null ? true : var.x.field > 0`. This applies to validations, preconditions, and test assertions alike.
- Keep assertion `error_message` text a statement of the guaranteed behaviour. It becomes the documentation of the contract when a test fails.
- Names and tags are a contract. A change that alters any `Name` or `Tier` value in `tests/defaults.tftest.hcl` is a breaking change for the platform roots that discover the network by tag.

## Where to add a feature

Each submodule owns one concern and has one reason to change. The root only composes.

| Concern | Lives in |
| --- | --- |
| A subnet or route-table attribute, the `per_az`/`shared` behaviour, subnet naming | `modules/subnets`: add the variable with validation, render it in `main.tf`, add a test. Then expose it in the root `subnets` object type and pass it through in `main.tf`. |
| A route destination or target type | `modules/routes` (the typed `routes` object and its exclusivity validations), then the root `subnets.routes` object type and `locals.resolved_routes`. A target that names something the root creates is resolved in `locals.tf`, never inside the submodule. |
| Endpoint attributes, endpoint policies, the endpoint security group | `modules/endpoints`. The root passes subnet and route-table IDs it looks up from the tiers; it never builds security-group rules. |
| Flow-log destinations, the key policy, the delivery role | `modules/flow-logs`. Policy JSON is built there and nowhere else. |
| Internet, egress-only, and NAT gateways, Elastic IPs | `modules/internet`. The root resolves `<tier>/<az_key>` to a subnet ID before calling it. |
| VPC arguments, secondary CIDRs, encryption control, the default security group | Root `vpc.tf` and `variables.tf`. |
| Cross-tier validation the submodule cannot see (a NAT gateway in an undeclared subnet, a `nat_gateway_key` that `internet` does not create, an endpoint in an undeclared tier) | Preconditions on `aws_vpc.this` in `vpc.tf`, with the helper sets in `locals.tf`; or `checks.tf` when the situation is valid but usually unintended. |
| Outputs, including the `vpc`, `private_subnets`, and `flow_logs` compatibility shapes | Root `outputs.tf`. The compatibility shapes are frozen. |
| IPAM pools and the delegated administrator | `modules/ipam` and `modules/ipam-organization-admin`, which the root consumes only through `ipam.pool_id`. |

Rules that apply everywhere: no data sources (derive from inputs; the `flow-logs` fallback is the one documented exception and must not grow), every variable has a description, a type, and a validation where a wrong value would otherwise fail at apply time, every output has a description, defaults are the secure choice (nothing reaches the internet, nothing is public, nothing is unencrypted or unlogged unless declared), and any new managed resource gets a `create_*` flag and a matching bring-your-own input so outputs stay identical either way.

## Commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). The scope is the submodule or root file the change touches.

```text
feat(internet): support private NAT gateways
fix(flow-logs): scope the delivery policy to the supplied log group
docs: explain per_az versus shared route tables
test(routes): cover prefix-list destinations
feat!: replace vpc_cidr with cidr_block and ipam
```

Append `!` after the type or scope for a breaking change and add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer explaining what consumers must do. Breaking changes ship only in a major release with an entry in the upgrade guide.

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] `make check` passes locally.
- [ ] New behaviour has a test; changed validations have both a passing and an `expect_failures` run.
- [ ] Variables and outputs have descriptions; `make docs` regenerated the README tables with terraform-docs v0.20.0.
- [ ] No `Name` or `Tier` value in `tests/defaults.tftest.hcl` changed, or the change is marked breaking.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has an entry under `## [Unreleased]` in the right category.
- [ ] Breaking changes carry `!`, a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer, and an update to `docs/UPGRADE-<major>.md`.
- [ ] Examples still initialise and validate; a new feature worth showing has an example.
- [ ] No data sources, no hard-coded account, region, or partition, no new defaults that weaken security.

## Release process

Releases are cut by maintainers.

1. Move the `## [Unreleased]` entries in `CHANGELOG.md` under a new `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading, add its compare link, and merge that change to `main`.
2. Create a signed annotated tag on the merge commit. The signing key must be registered with GitHub so the tag shows as Verified:

   ```sh
   git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "aws.modules.vpc vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

3. Dispatch the `module-release` workflow (`.github/workflows/module-release.yml`) from the tag with `release_tag = vX.Y.Z`: `gh workflow run module-release.yml --ref vX.Y.Z -f release_tag=vX.Y.Z`. It verifies the signed tag, formatting, validation, tests, and generated docs, then publishes the GitHub release. Never dispatch it from `main`: the workflow checks that the tag points at the revision it checked out, and a maintenance release of an older line is cut from that line's commit.
4. Announce the release with the commit SHA. Consumers pin that SHA, not the tag:

   ```hcl
   source = "git::https://github.com/hatan4ik/aws.modules.vpc.git?ref=<commit-sha>" # vX.Y.Z
   ```

Tags are never moved or deleted once published. A bad release is followed by a new patch release.
